<h3>Description</h3>

<p align="justify">The goal of the project is to help psychologists to save time in their study of a patient.
Psychologists actually spend many hours to analyse the therapeutic session and some of them give up these sessions.
The goal of the project is to classify sentences corresponding of the responses of patients into multiple behavioral classes.
Each sentence represent the reaction of someone in a peticular situation.</p>


<h3>Model used</h3>

<p align="justify">The technique of word embedding has been used to translate our texts into something understandable for our tools.
Several approches were tested and the decision was made to use some neural networks in order to classify our dataset.
LSTM were mainly used because they have proved their efficiency in textual analysis.
Moreover, one word in a sentence can be a sign of a pathology (angry for example) and determine the classification.
CNN were used as well because a further goal will be to create a pattern recognition tool.
Sentences were translated into images each word in a row, each column as a dimension of embedded space.</p>


<h3>Personal improvement</h3

<p align="justify">Word embedding is a sub part of Natural Language Processing. I enjoyed applying several NLP methods through this project and understanding even more about neural networks.
I learned how LSTM works, how they are differents from the classical RNN architecture.
All the scripts running under Python and using Tensorlow, I learned to develop a fonctionnal tool destinated to run for the french medicine as a service.</p>
