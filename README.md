<h3>Description</h3>

<p align="justify">The goal of the project is to help psychologists to save time in their study of a patient.
Psychologists actually spend many hours to analyse the therapeutic session and some of them give up these sessions.
The goal of the project is to classify sentences corresponding of the responses of patients into multiple behavioral classes.
Each sentence represent the reaction of someone in a peticular situation.</p>


<h3>Model used</h3>

<p align="justify">The technique of word embedding has been used to translate our texts into something understandable for our tools.
Several approches were tested and the decision was made to use some neural networks in order to classify our dataset
LSTM were mainly used because they have proved their efficiency in textual analysis.
CNN were used as well because a further goal will be to create a pattern recognition tool.</p>


<h3>Personal improvement</h3

<p align="justify">Word embedding is a fundamental of NLP and I enjoyed create a model based only on my dataset with no external biases.
I learned how LSTM works, how they are differents from the classical RNN.
CNN are very strong and I'm enthousistic to learn how object recognition works.</p>
